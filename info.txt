There is still a lot to do, but time was limited. To be honest, I was so absorbed, that I used something about 2 hours. Then I realized that it's already after time, sorry for that.

I changed textContent to textContent for cross-browsing.

In normal situation I probably try to use jQuery to complete this kind of task, but I can code it, in pure JavaScript

There is a lot of alerts to check everything.

Things to do on start when upgrading (only first thoughts, when coding):
- better how many childrens algorithm
- to kill error msg when id frog above max array id
- better male or female algorithm
- check if provided by user name is male or female
- changing "kill" button with "x" button on each frog
- change name of each frog after clicking it
